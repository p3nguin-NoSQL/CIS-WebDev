        <p> Major browsers such as Google Chrome have been restricting adblockers. Many mobile devices now have no
            adbocker support.</p>
        <p>This had led to a rise in malware on mobile devices. Increased reliance on smartphones has also increased the
            market
            for mobile malware. You risk having your information stolen, corrupted, or held for ransom.
