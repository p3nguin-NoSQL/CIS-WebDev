"1.) Readability: Minimalize the amount of underlined words. It was a little difficult reading some of the information provided on the webpages since they were underlined.
Adjustment: I adjusted the font families to be easier to read, and removed the underlines from the text

Adjustment: Used different text layouts and added a couple different fonts, and changed some of the font boldness to give some visual variety
